- Class: text
  Output: In this part we finally use some financial data. We will focus on using layers in ggplot2. We will plot time series of some stock exchanges' indexes and then tweak it and add some annotations.
  

- Class: text
  Output: Capabilities of the ggplot package are enormous. What is more, additional features are made available thanks to another packages like ggrepel which we'll be using here as well.
  

- Class: text
  Output: To help you better understand what you can do with ggplot download a cheatsheet from the Help menu and Cheat Sheets submenu.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: In how many ways you can plot one continuous variable?
  AnswerChoices: 1;4;6;10
  CorrectAnswer: 6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='6')
  Hint: Check the second column on the first page of the cheat sheet.

- Class: text
  Output: But before we will move to visualisation lets first have a look at our data. We will be using EuStockMarkets dataset containing the daily closing prices of major European stock indices - Germany DAX (Ibis), Switzerland SMI, France CAC, and UK FTSE. The data are sampled in business time, i.e., weekends and holidays are omitted.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First check the size of the dataset 'EuStockMarkets'.
  CorrectAnswer: dim(EuStockMarkets)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dim(EuStockMarkets)')
  Hint: You should use the dim command.

- Class: text
  Output: As you can see it consists of 1860 rows (days).

- Class: text
  Output: It is important to know what class of data this dataset is. Different functions accept different types (classes) of input. Other functions behave differently depends on type of input.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To check class of any R object just type class(nameofobject). Please check class of our EuStockMarkets object.
  CorrectAnswer: class(EuStockMarkets)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='class(EuStockMarkets)')
  Hint: Remember that size of letters matters.

- Class: text
  Output: It says that the class is matrix of the 'ts' type. 'ts' stands for time series.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's have a look inside this dataset. Please show first 6 rows of this matrix. 
  CorrectAnswer: head(EuStockMarkets)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(EuStockMarkets)')
  Hint: Use head() command to show first 6 rows. You can use tail() command to see last six rows by the way.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The 'ts' objects are treated in special way by the plot() function. Try it now. You will be surprised what simple plot() could do.
  CorrectAnswer: plot(EuStockMarkets)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(EuStockMarkets)')
  Hint: Type plot(EuStockMarkets)

- Class: text
  Output: As you can see plot() correctly recognised structure of our matrix and presented it in very convinient way.

- Class: text
  Output: But we want much more! What about colors, annotations or maybe it would be better to have all lines in one graph?

- Class: text
  Output: To have it all we need to switch to the ggplot package. It is already installed and loaded.

- Class: text
  Output: Unfortunately ggplot doesn't accept 'ts' objects. Therefore we must transform it to the data.frame class object (or tibble class object).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's create new variable data consisting our transformed table. To tranform 'ts' object to 'data.frame' object and preserve all time functionalities please type data.frame(as.matrix(EuStockMarkets), date = time(EuStockMarkets)). Assign it to the variable 'data'.
  CorrectAnswer: data <- data.frame(as.matrix(EuStockMarkets), date = time(EuStockMarkets))
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data <- data.frame(as.matrix(EuStockMarkets), date = time(EuStockMarkets))', 'data <- data.frame(as.matrix(EuStockMarkets), date=time(EuStockMarkets))' )
  Hint: Type data <- data.frame(as.matrix(EuStockMarkets), date = time(EuStockMarkets))

- Class: text
  Output: Few words of explanation what you have done. Such nested commands are working from inside-out. First 'ts' object was transformed to the simple matrix and new column 'date' was added which consist all dates in the time-series form (time command did it). Then data.frame function just changed class of this new matrix to dataframe.

- Class: text
  Output: We are almost ready to work with ggplot. To have smooth and easy experience with ggplot we need data in the long form.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Right now our table is in the wide form. That means we have separate column for each indice. That is four columns plus one with dates. How many columns should we have in a long form?
  AnswerChoices: 2;3;4;5;6
  CorrectAnswer: 3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='3')
  Hint: We should have column with indices' names, values and dates. That's three columns.

- Class: text
  Output: For such transformation we need function pivot_longer from the 'tidyr' package. The problem is that it isn't loaded and we need it only once. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In such situation it is better to call package directly with the name of desired function. In R we do it using two colons. Let's create new variable data_long from the data with use of tidyr::pivot_longer function. Put names to "Indices" column.
  CorrectAnswer: data_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(data, cols = 1:4, names_to="Indices")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('data_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(data, cols = 1:4, names_to="Indices")','data_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(data, cols = 1:4, names_to = "Indices")', 'data_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(data, cols=1:4, names_to="Indices")')
  Hint: Type data_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(data, cols = firstcolumn:lastcolumn, names_to="Indices"). 'firstcolumn:lastcolumn' of course means columns which we want to collapse to the new 'Indices' column.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Did it work correctly? Let's 'View()' result.
  CorrectAnswer: View(data_long)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(data_long)')
  Hint: R is case sensitive. 'view' doesn't work. 

- Class: text
  Output: As you can see 'View()' function creates very convenient excel-like table which columns are sortable! 

- Class: text
  Output: Ok. We are ready to go! Let's start from the simple line graph. Look at the cheat sheet and check what is the name of appropriate geometry.

- Class: text
  Output: First, we must prepare our canvas using the ggplot() function. Then we can add our geometries. We must decide what aesthetics we will use. 

- Class: text
  Output: It is good to think about it before actual plotting because we have to options 1) we will use the same columns in all geometries or 2) we will use different columns in different geometries. 

- Class: text
  Output: In our case we opt for option 2. Therefore we start from empty canvas using ggplot() and add aesthetics arguments in the geometry calls.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Recall that in ggplot we add new elements with + sign. So let's use geom_line where x = date and y = value. Our data = data_long of course so we start with ggplot(data_long).
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(data_long) + geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value))
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('ggplot(data_long) + geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value))','ggplot(data_long)+geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value))','ggplot(data_long) + geom_line(aes(x=date, y=value))','ggplot(data_long)+geom_line(aes(x=date, y=value))')
  Hint: Type ggplot(data_long) + geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value)


- Class: text
  Output: Definitely there is something. Something black. Without color the graph is rather useless. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's add a color to differentiate indices. Use arrow key to scroll back and add col = Indices after comma to aes()
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(data_long) + geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value, col = Indices))
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('ggplot(data_long) + geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value, col = Indices))','ggplot(data_long)+geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value, col = Indices))','ggplot(data_long) + geom_line(aes(x=date, y=value, col=Indices))','ggplot(data_long)+geom_line(aes(x=date, y=value, col=Indices))')
  Hint: Type ggplot(data_long) + geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value, col = Indices)

- Class: text
  Output: It is much better now. But what if we would like to show what was the maximum value of indices?

- Class: script
  Output: First we need to adjust our data. This will require multiple steps, which we will build up gradually using %>%. Edit the R script, save it, then type submit() when you are ready. Type reset() to reset the script to its original state.
  AnswerTests: script_vals_identical()
  Hint:  Read the directions in the script carefully. If R is giving you an error, try to understand what it is telling you. Use ? to get help.
  Script: Script1.R

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: plt <- ggplot(data_long) + geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value, col = Indices))
  CorrectAnswer: plt <- ggplot(data_long) + geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value, col = Indices))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plt <- ggplot(data_long) + geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value, col = Indices))')
  Hint: Type plt <- ggplot(data_long) + geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value, col = Indices))

- Class: mult_question
  Output: To add a text to figure we need to use additional geometry called geom_text. Which arguments it requires?
  AnswerChoices: x,y,label;x,y,z; x,y,text;x,y,annotation
  CorrectAnswer: x,y,label
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='x,y,label')
  Hint: Cheet sheet is your friend.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: plt variable holds now our previous plot. Now we only need to add a new layer - plt + geom_text(aes(x = date, y = ?, label = ?))
  CorrectAnswer: plt + geom_text(aes(x = date, y = max_val, label = max_val))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plt + geom_text(aes(x = date, y = max_val, label = max_val))')
  Hint: Try plt + geom_text(aes(x = date, y = max_val, label = max_val)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We almost have it but text should be above lines. Shouldn't it? Lets move it 100 points up.
  CorrectAnswer: plt + geom_text(aes(x = date, y = max_val+100, label = max_val))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plt + geom_text(aes(x = date, y = max_val+100, label = max_val))','plt + geom_text(aes(x = date, y = max_val + 100, label = max_val))')
  Hint: It's enough to type y = max_val + 100 in the geom_text.

- Class: text
  Output: Better but there is still issue with overlapping texts. Luckily one smart guy had the same problem and solved it! To share his solution he created package called ggrepel.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: It is already installed so we can use it. Just replace geom_text with geom_text_repel. Ignore warning messages.
  CorrectAnswer: plt + geom_text_repel(aes(x = date, y = max_val+100, label = max_val))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plt + geom_text_repel(aes(x = date, y = max_val+100, label = max_val))','plt + geom_text_repel(aes(x = date, y = max_val + 100, label = max_val))')
  Hint: Use arrow to scroll back once replace text and voila!


- Class: text
  Output: Don't you think it would be better if the text would have the same color as corresponding line?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's do it! Scroll back and add col argument to geom_text_repel as you did in geom_line.
  CorrectAnswer: plt + geom_text_repel(aes(x = date, y = max_val + 100, label = max_val, col = Indices))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plt + geom_text_repel(aes(x = date, y = max_val + 100, label = max_val, col = Indices))','plt + geom_text_repel(aes(x = date, y = max_val + 100, label = max_val, col=Indices))')
  Hint: add 'col = Indices' to aes part.

- Class: text
  Output: We can't stop here! Let's add another layer with red point indicating our max values.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First update our plt variable. Type plt <- plt + geom_text_repel(aes(x = date, y = max_val + 100, label = max_val, col = Indices))
  CorrectAnswer: plt <- plt + geom_text_repel(aes(x = date, y = max_val + 100, label = max_val, col = Indices))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plt <- plt + geom_text_repel(aes(x = date, y = max_val + 100, label = max_val, col = Indices))')
  Hint: Type plt <- plt + geom_text_repel(aes(x = date, y = max_val + 100, label = max_val, col = Indices))

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now add to our new plt geom_point geometry with argument col = "red" but AFTER the aes() part. We want all points to be red.
  CorrectAnswer: plt + geom_point(aes(x = date, y = max_val), col = "red")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plt + geom_point(aes(x = date, y = max_val), col = "red")','plt + geom_point(aes(x = date, y = max_val), col="red")','plt + geom_point(aes(x=date, y=max_val), col="red")')
  Hint: Check arguments of geom_point in the cheat sheet.

- Class: text
  Output: Now everybody knows what is most important in our figure. Or would know if we added labels to axes and title. We can do it very simply using functions xlab(), ylab() and ggtitle() or labs(). But it's time to finish our journey.

- Class: text
  Output: We can change colors, fonts, sizes, scale and all elements of our plots with help of the cheat sheet and plenty of additional packages.

- Class: text
  Output: But as a final touch just change this awful grey background and improve other elements as well. Preferably in one go!

- Class: text
  Output: To achieve it we'll use different themes.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: How many themes offers ggplot2?
  AnswerChoices: 2;4;6;8;10
  CorrectAnswer: 8
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='8')
  Hint: Check the cheat sheet again.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We put also package 'ggthemes' at your disposal. You can play with them now. Finally use plt + theme_economist() to finish this lesson.
  CorrectAnswer: plt + theme_economist()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plt + theme_economist()')
  Hint: Type plt + theme_economist() to finish.

- Class: mult_question
